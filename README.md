# FoodTemplate

A template built (or rather, hacked together) using [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). The idea is that it can build a quick and dirty, easy version of a site. I hope to touch it up a little so it's less hacked together and more crafted. We'll see how that goes.
